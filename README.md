Hello!

For the longest time, i have wanted to work with pygame to create some kind of game but i was too lazy to do anything. But that changes today! I have started this project in the hopes that it will lead to many more newer projects.

This project is a coffee shop - based game. We will we able to make coffee and toast to the customers that come in. In the initial run, i am going to randomly give coffees and toasts to my customers, maybe in a later update that will change.
